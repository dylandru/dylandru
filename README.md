# Dylan Drummey (dylandru) 👋

I'm a developer and researcher working with the **Chicago Cubs** as a Baseball Sciences Analyst (June 2025). With a strong passion for baseball, data analytics, and computer vision along with experience working for the *Brewers*, *Kentucky Baseball*, and *Prep Baseball*, the projects included in this repository represent a great portion of my public work.

## 📝 Writings & Research

Before my time with baseball companies, a great deal of my time was spent on writing about baseball research. You can find my work here: 

* **Baseball Prospectus:** [Work](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/author/dylan-drummey/)
* **Pitcher List:** [Work](https://pitcherlist.com/author/dylan-drummey/)
* **TDA Baseball**: [Work](https://www.tdabaseball.com/blog/categories/dylan-collection)

## 🚀 Featured Project: BaseballCV

A significant focus of my work is **[BaseballCV](https://github.com/BaseballCV/BaseballCV)**. **BaseballCV** is a comprehensive suite of tools and models designed to advance the application of Computer Vision in baseball. The project aims to provide access to datasets, pre-trained models, and tools for baseball analytics to foster innovation in the sport for public contributors. While I will no longer be maintaining the project with my current role, the project is in good hands and should continue to grow.
